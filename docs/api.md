# QuiltHosting Public API (v1)

**Live HTML:** [/docs/api.html](../public/docs/api.html)  
**Base URL:** `https://quilthosting.com/api/v1`  
**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer qh_…` (create keys in Admin → API)

| Method | Path | Scope | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| GET | `/me` | read | Tenant id, name, slug, plan |
| GET | `/members?status=` | read | Members (max 500) |
| GET | `/events` | read | Events |
| GET | `/payments` | read | Payments |
| GET | `/levels` | read | Active membership levels |

## Authentication

```bash
curl -s https://quilthosting.com/api/v1/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer qh_…"
```

Optional query form (less secure): `?api_key=qh_…`

API routes skip the site-access password gate; the key is the only auth.

## Examples

```bash
curl -s "https://quilthosting.com/api/v1/members?status=active" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer qh_…" 

curl -s https://quilthosting.com/api/v1/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer qh_…"
```

## Zapier / Make

1. Admin → API → create a **read** key (copy once).
2. Zapier: **Webhooks by Zapier** GET, or **Code by Zapier** with `fetch`.
3. Poll `/members` or `/payments` on a schedule; filter by `created_at`.
4. Map into Sheets, Mailchimp, QBO, etc.

No official Zapier app listing yet — custom webhooks are the supported path.
